Before we begin processing UCE data there are a couple of things that needs to be done first:
  
  1. Get a Mac or Linux machine #Phyluce is not supported on Windows, however Oracle VM Virtual Box with linux machine installed 
     is a solution. (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (https://linuxmint.com/download.php)
  
  2. Download python 2.X version #Phyluce only run on this version of python
  
  3. Install Java #Java is needed for illumiprocessor which also comes with phyluce package
  
  4. Add developer's repository to your channel list (conda config --add channels http://conda.binstar.org/faircloth-lab)
  
  5. Install phyluce using code: conda install phyluce
     Creating a virtual environment: conda create --name phyluce phyluce #Recommended
  
  6. Update and upgrade all the programs downloaded to avoid errors
  
  7. Dowload all sequencing data and put them all into one single folder
  
 Now we are ready to begin!
