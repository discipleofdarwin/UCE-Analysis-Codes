# UCE-Analysis-Codes
Codes used to analyze sequencing data of Ultraconserved elements

I do not own anything, all the codes come from [phyluce](https://phyluce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) page and [Faircloth lab](https://github.com/faircloth-lab/phyluce)

I edited and annotated each code I used to make it easier to understand for people without any experience
